	<h2 style="color:Tomato;" >THE ORIGGIN OF THE CHURCH<h2/>
	<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church had its roots in the
	Millerite movement of the 1830s to the 1840s, during the
	period of the Second Great Awakening, and was officially founded
	in 1863. Prominent figures in the early church included
	Hiram Edson, Ellen G. White, her husband James Springer White, 
	Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews. Over the ensuing decades the church 
	expanded from its original base in New England to become an international 
	organization. Significant developments such the reviews initiated by evangelicals 
	Donald Barnhouse and Walter Martin, in the 20th century led to 
	its recognition as a Christian denomination.</p>
